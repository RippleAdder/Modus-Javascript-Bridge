# Modus-Javascript-Bridge

Javascript bridge that provides native functionality to web bundles running within Modus Communicate

## Table of Contents

[Getting Started](#getting-started)  
[Documentation](#documentation)

## Getting Started

### Plain Old Javascript

Include the **modus-js-bridge.js** file in your application
_TEMPORARY NOTE: the modus-js-bridge.js file is located in 'example/js/modus-js-bridge'_

```html
<script type="module" src="js/modus-js-bridge.js"></script>
<script>
  Modus.getCurrentUserName();
</script>
```

### Using as a module

Include the **modus-js-bridge.js** file in your application
_TEMPORARY NOTE: the modus-js-bridge.js file is located in 'example/js/modus-js-bridge'_

```javascript
import Modus from "./js/modus-js-bridge";
Modus.getCurrentUserName();
```

### General Usage

```javascript
Modus.getCurrentUserName().then((username) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + username);
});
```

### Promises and Polyfills

This library heavily relies on native JavaScript promises. This may require a polyfill in order for the bridge to work in older versions of Modus Communicate and Internet Explorer. We suggest using something like "promise-polyfill". See https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill for more details

## Follow Up Methods:

### sendFollowup

Triggers a followup to happen within the app. It allows the user of this function to override the link added to the followup as well by setting the link param to be whatever link you want to send in an email with the appropriate templated email body that is the default behavior of the app. The other two params are optional and can be used in cases where web bundles need to indicate what step to open to in the followup link or indicate what bundle the link is being sent from.

##### Parameters

- **step**: (string) this is another item that will get appended to the url of the short link sent. It was used to indicate to the web bundle what "step" to open to when loading the link. Omitting it by setting it to "" or null will cause it to not be appended to the url.
- **bundleName**: (string) this is a string that indicates what web bundle is, it then gets added as a url param to the short link. Omitting it by setting it to "" or null will cause it to not be appended to the url.
- **link**: (string) this can be any link you would like to send in the followup, omitting it by setting it to "" or null will result in the app placing in the next followuplink short link for the media item associated with this bundle

### previewNextFollowupLink

### asyncHttpRequest

Queues an http request in the mobile app's local database to be run when the app next has an available network connection. The app will retry a number of times and / or for a period of time in the event of a failure. You can provide a success and error callback function, but these functions only indicate the success or error of the request being parsed by the mobile app and placed into the database for future processing. The success or error callback functions do not indicate success or error of the actual HTTP request. Note: The request may end up firing at a much later date in the future (when the device is next online). In essence, you are firing off this request "blind" and your application must not depend on the outcome of this request. Example use cases include posting results of a quiz, or posting custom analytics data to a third party provider.
